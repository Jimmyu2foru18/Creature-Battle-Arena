  - Environment tiles (grass, water, paths, buildings)
  - UI elements (menus, buttons, health bars)

### 2. Organize Assets
- Place all sprites in their respective folders under assets
- Ensure consistent naming conventions (e.g., creature1_idle.png, creature1_attack.png)

### 3. Import Settings
- Select all sprite assets in the FileSystem dock
- In the Import dock, set appropriate import settings:
  - Filter: Nearest (for pixel art)
  - Mipmaps: Off
  - Repeat: Disabled

## Building the Battle System

### 1. Create Battle Scene
- Create a new scene (Scene > New Scene)
- Select "Node2D" as the root node and name it "BattleScene"
- Save it as "scenes/BattleScene.tscn"

### 2. Design Battle UI
- Add a CanvasLayer node for UI elements
- Create the following UI components:
  - Health bars for player and opponent creatures
  - Move selection buttons
  - Battle log text box
  - Options for items, switching creatures, or fleeing

### 3. Implement Battle Logic
- Open BattleSystem.gd and implement:
  - Turn management
  - Move execution
  - Damage calculation with type effectiveness
  - Status effects
  - Victory/defeat conditions
  - Experience and reward distribution

### 4. Connect Battle UI to Logic
- Create a script for the BattleScene
- Connect UI elements to battle logic
- Implement animations for attacks and effects

## Implementing the Creature System

### 1. Define Creature Data Structure
- Edit creatures.json to define creature properties:
  - ID, name, type(s)

- Set breakpoints at critical sections
- Monitor variables during runtime

### 3. Playtesting
- Have others test your game
- Gather feedback on difficulty, pacing, and fun factor
- Make adjustments based on feedback

## Exporting and Releasing
